Description: 
    Provides a fully-functional Shiny application for running rapid
    study–test (old/new) recognition experiments with any number of
    blocks.  Stimuli are supplied as a data frame or Excel file with
    columns ‘block’, ‘type’ (study/test), and ‘item’.  During each
    block the app flashes study words for a user-defined duration and
    inter-stimulus interval, then presents test probes that remain on
    screen until the participant chooses “Old” or “New”.  Response
    accuracy is computed on the fly and a tidy trial-level data frame
    is returned automatically when the experiment ends.  The package
    aims to let behavioural researchers prototype memory tasks in
    minutes with no HTML or JavaScript knowledge.
